## ResNet i.e. Residual Neural Network

- This is the final and also the optional assignment of the course. The goal of this to understand ResNet architecture and implement it using TensorFlow.

- Unlike the previous assignments, here we are not expected you to write code, but we are giving the code and you have to understand it and run it on your local machine. Later you can try implementing it yourself.

- Watch video 14 and 15 from this playlist(u can watch other videos also in this playlist) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF

- Download the entire directory structure from the ResNet folder in Week-5 and study the Residual_Networks_v2a.ipynb file.

- Run the code and understand the architecture of ResNet.

- If you encounter an error while loading the dataset, then download train_signs.h5 and test_signs.h5 from this https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayanmaity/hand-sign-resnet/input and replace them with the existing dataset.

- You may encounter errors due to version incompatibiliy, this code should work with latest version of TensorFlow. If you encounter any error, then google it and try to resolve it. If you are unable to resolve it, then you can DM me.
